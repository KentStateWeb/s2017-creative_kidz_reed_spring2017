      <h4>Toddler Activity Director</h4>
      <p>Hello! I'm Teacher Kathy, and I'm the Co-Teacher for the teaching
      center. I started as a floater/substitute in February of 2012, and
      am very excited to now be able to dedicate myself to the Jr. Toddler
      class full time! I have a Bachelors degree in Music Education from
      University of Akron and continuing education in Early Childhood.
      I've worked with kids of all ages since I was one myself. I love
      working with children because they're so honest, fun-loving and do
      and say the most outrageous things! I find myself laughing a lot when
      I'm with them. I love to see them learn and grow as they discover
      and experience the world around them. </p></span>
