<h3>Kathy Clemson</h3>

<p>Hello! I'm Teacher Kathy, and I'm the Co-Teacher for the teaching
center. I started as a floater/substitute in February of 2012, and
am very excited to now be able to dedicate myself to the Jr. Toddler
class full time! I have a Bachelors degree in Music Education from
University of Akron and continuing education in Early Childhood.
I've worked with kids of all ages since I was one myself. I love
working with children because they're so honest, fun-loving and do
and say the most outrageous things! I find myself laughing a lot when
I'm with them. I love to see them learn and grow as they discover
and experience the world around them. </p>
