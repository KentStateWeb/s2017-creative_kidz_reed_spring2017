  <p>We know that children learn best when they're actively engaged.
  Children have the opportunity to discover their own special talents
  and best ways to learn while feeling valued for who they are,
  while having the guidance and freedom to learn in meaningful ways.
  We believe that all children are talented, capable and special,
  whether they enjoy music or math.  We know they learn Science,
  Math, Reading and Writing concepts through hands-on, sensory-oriented
  activities. Creative Kidz’ unique curriculum gives children the
  guidance and freedom to construct their own body of knowledge in
  ways most meaningful to them.</p>

    <h2> Infants </h2>
    <h3>Ages: 6wks to 16 months</h3>
    <p>“Primary Care” is the key phrase in understanding the quality
      of care your baby will receive as a part of our Infant Care
      Program.  Each teacher is assigned a group (no more than 4)
      of infants to care for. They work hand in hand with each parent
      to create a specialized care plan for the children in their group.
      We offer a safe, warm, and loving environment affording each
      Infant the best opportunities for growth. We foster this growth
      through exploration of the world around them. They have access
      to our centers as well as our Bye-Bye buggies and will take
      rides on days when weather permits.  Each child is provided
      with their own crib and sheets.  These are never shared by
      multiple students and are disinfected as well as laundered
      several times per day.  We use neutral cleaning products and
      steam to disinfect this room limiting any harsh chemicals our infants may come into contact with.  To keep our Infant room clean and germ free we restrict access by anyone other than our Infants and Teachers.  We do this in hopes of keeping the germs of the outside world from entering the class.  All of our caring Infant Room Staff treat each child as though he/she is their own.  They are also trained in Infant CPR, First Aid, and we have other staff members with Medication Administration (MAT) training. </p>

      <p>Our teachers set goals with our parents and work with each
        Infant to reach certain developmental milestones.  We use
        educational activities that focus on; rolling over, walking,
        grasping, crawling, pulling up, and mastering of fine motor
        skills.  Each day the Infants will take part in several group
        circle times intended to aid in verbal communication and
        social interaction.  Our staff will engage them in singing
        songs, reading stories and playing with sensory objects.
        Our educators also teach American Sign Language as an
        alternative form of communication.</p>

    <h2>Toddlers</h2>
    <h3>Ages: 16 months to 24 months</h3>

    <p>Our Toddler room is full of action and adventure!  This room is designed
      to aid in the growth and development of a toddler by the completion and
      the refining of skills learned in our Infant room.  Children are given
      the opportunity to increase core strength, fine and large motor skills,
      walking, running, jumping, and communication.  Addressing these skills is
      very important for the future success of the children.</p>

      <p>Our schedule in this class allows the student time to play, learn,
        rest, and explore the world around them. Circle times include the
        introduction of colors, shapes, date, time, music, and movement.
        Throughout the day the class will sit down together for a few minutes
        of group learning.  Students will interact socially together and with
        the teachers to make learning fun.  By using flashcards, sign language,
        and sensory boxes our teachers aid the children in learning with all of
        their senses.  The students in this class will engage in table
        activities each day that focus on strengthening their fine motor skills
        as well as their ability to follow simple directions.  Our children
        also have the opportunity to express themselves through guided and
        free art activities several times weekly.</p>

    <h3>Ages: Two Year Olds: 24 months to 36 months</h3>
    <p>Our Two Year Old Room is set up for what in some cases can be the
      most difficult time in a child’s life; the year in which a child may be
      expected to start caring for his/her self: using the bathroom, wiping,
      washing their hands, dressing themselves, and proper eating etiquette.
      We strive to give each two year old child a sense of routine and structure
      that will aid in mastering each of these valuable skills.</p>

      <p>Our bathroom is set up specially in order to accommodate potty training
        with two separate bathrooms and potties side by side at different heights.
        This allows 2 children to use the bathroom together helping to eliminate
        any anxiety or fear that might occur.  We have smaller potties which
        allow small children to feel comfortable and at peace with the potty
        itself.  Group potty time helps with the younger children who learn by
        watching a child that has already mastered the proper technique.  We
        also have a potty that is standard size which allows the children, who
        have mastered the smaller potties, to practice the routine of placing
        and using a step stool and the proper placement and removal of a potty
        seat.</p>

        <p>At this age our children’s brains are like sponges.  Our teachers’
          goal each day is to educate and expose our students to the world
          around them. Our class has two circle times per day which are
          designed for group interaction and the establishment of a time to
          focus on instruction.   After circle time the class breaks up into
          smaller groups for free play and guided activities.  Each student
          will have one on one activity time with a teacher developing fine
          motor skills and creativity through art and expression. Our students
          also participate with stories, puppet play, and song and dance times
          daily.</p>

    <h2>Preschool</h2>
    <h3>Ages: 3 years old</h3>

    <p>This is the first class in our center that begins our students’
      preparation for school.  We have a core curriculum based on the
      Virginia Standards of Learning. We work closely with the Augusta Count
      School system, and teach from the “Blueprint Curriculum.” Our Preschool
      Class goes through a year-long process of exploration and exposure to
      our world, while honing the basic skills needed for advancement into
      our Jr. Kindergarten class.</p>

      <p>Our teachers follow a weekly thematic calendar designed to expose
        the children to what is happening in our world at that time.
        The teachers focus class discussions, stories, worksheets, and circle
        times within each of these weekly themes. Circle times last between
        20 and 30 minutes each day and gradually grow in dynamic as the
        students learn new material. Telling time, date, colors, shapes,
        counting, Spanish, Math, patterns, letter and number recognition,
        name recognition, and writing all occur throughout the course of their
        day, whether it be during circle time or small group activities.</p>

    <h2>Jr. Kindergarten</h2>
    <h3>4 and 5 year olds</h3>

    <p>This class is our next and final step in your children’s preparation
      for school.  We have a core curriculum based on the Virginia Standards
      of Learning, and lesson plans based on Augusta County Schools “Blueprint

      day with several circle times and educational activities which create a
      great classroom setting.  We focus our efforts on teaching our students
      everything they need to know before entering kindergarten.  This program
      was established under the supervision of our areas local kindergarten
      teachers.  They supported us in our efforts to create a class that was
      structured to resemble the kindergarten classes in our local school system.
      They provided us a list of skills that would make our student’s transition
      to local school systems as effortless as possible, giving our students
      the skills needed to be successful and advance in their efforts throughout
       school.</p>

       <p>We offer a structured educational and nurturing environment.  Our
         teachers conduct two circle times per day centered on our core
         curriculum and our weekly thematic units.  Our students have a chance

         and free dance daily.  Guided activities are conducted each day under
         the supervision of our certified teachers.  We focus on letter
         recognition, hand writing, one to one correspondence, patterns,
         telling time, math, and counting.  Our students learn to follow
         multi-step directions given during class activities.They also work on
         writing short sentences, sight words, spelling, grammar, Spanish,
         adding, subtracting, reading, and cognitive skills.   We strive to
         give our children the best foot forward and prepare them for the
         education that they will receive when they go to school. Our teachers
         also promote literacy and language skills through creative storytelling.
         They participate in cognitive activities, vocabulary expansion, and
         alphabet knowledge in an effort to expand our student’s oral language
         skills before heading off to school.<p>
